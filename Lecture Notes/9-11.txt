Merge Sort time costs:

Time to recursively sort the left, time to recursively sort the right, time to merge
merge time = 2k-1

Cost of recursively sorting the left:
	T(n) = n/2
Cost of recursively sorting the right:
	T(n) = n/2

Total costs:				v-merge cost
T(n) = T(n/2) + T(n/2) + [2(n/2) + 1]
Left Cost-^			^-Right cost

each subarray will be recursively split to be sorted, so if array started at size n, 
each subarray will be size n/2
